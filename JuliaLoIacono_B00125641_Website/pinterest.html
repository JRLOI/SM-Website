            <p>Getting Ideas
                The best way to use Pinterest for educational purposes would be for getting ideas from the visuals on Pinterest for project based learning and getting ideas from. Going onto Pinterest and pinning suitable material makes it much easier for the student and the teacher.

                Monitoring trends in education
                Pinterest is very trendy; and is a great way to monitor changing trends in social media.

                Examples of work
                Students can use Pinterest while doing an assignment or project so they know they are going in the right direction. Teachers can also use this as a way to show their students what is expected from them from past work.

                Organising your Ideas
                Pinterest is a great way of keeping your ideas organised by putting them into folders and labelling them. This makes them easy to find and view very quickly

                Promoting
                Pinterest is a great way to show off your work by posting it. If you think it is worth sharing, others
                may think it is worth pinning.

                Find Other Teachers
                Pinterest is a great way for teachers to find other teachers so they can share their ideas and tips
                with each other.
